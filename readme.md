KxMovie - movie player for iOS using ffmpeg
===========================================

### Build instructions:

First you need download, configure and build [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/index.html).
For this open console and type in
	
	cd kxmovie
	git submodule update --init	
	rake

### Usage

1. Drop files from kxmovie/output folder in your project.
2. Add frameworks: MediaPlayer, CoreAudio, AudioToolbox, Accelerate, QuartzCore, OpenGLES and libz.dylib .
3. Add libs: libkxmovie.a, libavcodec.a, libavformat.a, libavutil.a, libswscale.a, libswresample.a

For play movies (usage as UIViewController):

	ViewController *vc;
	vc = [KxMovieViewController movieViewControllerWithContentPath:path parameters:nil];
	[self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:nil];

or, for use as a UIView:

	KxMovieView * videoView;
	CGRect bounds = self.view.bounds;
	videoView = [KxMovieView movieViewControllerWithContentPath:path parameters:parameters withFrame:bounds];
	[vc.view addSubview:videoView];

See KxMovieExample demo project as example of using.

Also, you can include kxmovie as subproject.
