KxMovie - movie player for iOS using ffmpeg (modified by kinglonghuang)
===========================================

### Build instructions:

First you need download, configure and build [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/index.html).
For this open console and type in
	
	cd kxmovie
	git submodule update --init	
	rake 
Generally, rake will build the armv7,armv7s,i386,and the universal versions under the ./kvmovie folder
<br>you can also using one of these cmds below to specify the architecture:

	rake 
	rake build_ffmpeg_i386
	rake build_ffmpeg_armv7
	rake build_ffmpeg_armv7s

### Usage

1. Open the kxmovie.xcodeproj with Xcode and drop the kxmovie/ffmpeg_XX into your project.
2. Set the “header search path” to your “ffmpeg_XX/include” folder, something like "$(SRCROOT)/kxmovie/ffmpeg_armv7/include"
3. Command+B, enjoy yourself :)

Note: If you want to build only the armv7 version, delete the armv7s item in the “Vaild Architectures” row, or delete the armv7 item if you want to build only a armv7 version

For play movies:

	ViewController *vc;
	vc = [KxMovieViewController movieViewControllerWithContentPath:path parameters:nil];
	[self presentViewController:vc animated:YES completion:nil];

See KxMovieExample demo project as example of using.

Also, you can include kxmovie as subproject.
Look at [kxtorrent](https://github.com/kolyvan/kxtorrent) as example.
